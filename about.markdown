                Welcome! I'm Emma Bentley, a dedicated music educator and professional musician and with over 4 years of
                experience in performance and teaching. My journey in music began at an early age, and I've had the privilege
                of studying with some wonderful teachers throughout my musical journey. These experiences have shaped my approach to teaching, allowing me to bring real-world
                performance experience into my lessons while maintaining a strong foundation in pedagogy.
            </p>

            <h2 class="font-display text-2xl font-bold text-primary dark:text-secondary mt-8 mb-4">Musical Journey</h2>
            <p class="text-slate-600 dark:text-slate-400">
                My musical education includes a Bachelor of Science in Music Education from Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) in Cleveland, Ohio, where I honed my skills as both a
                performer and educator. While studying at CWRU, I had the privilege of studying clarinet as my primary instrument, and percussion as a secondary. Throughout my undergraduate career, I prioritized comprehensively learning all instruments, so that I may better help future students. I was lucky enough to have performed on the cello, french horn, trumpet, and saxophone, in addition to my studies.
            </p>

            <h2 class="font-display text-2xl font-bold text-primary dark:text-secondary mt-8 mb-4">Teaching Philosophy</h2>
            <p class="text-slate-600 dark:text-slate-400">
                I believe that music education has a unique capability to build students’ self-confidence and self-efficacy. My teaching approach combines
                traditional techniques with trauma-informed cultural competency, creating an engaging learning environment that promotes both
                technical excellence and creative expression. Whether working with beginners or advanced students, I tailor
                my instruction to meet individual needs and goals. I strive for my students to walk away from our experiences with a deeper appreciation for music as well as hold musical and life skills that they can apply to their lives in various meaningful ways.
            </p>

            <h2 class="font-display text-2xl font-bold text-primary dark:text-secondary mt-8 mb-4">Performance Career</h2>
            <p class="text-slate-600 dark:text-slate-400">
                As an active performer, I regularly appear with orchestras, and chamber ensembles.
                These experiences inform my teaching and allow me to provide students with insights into the professional
                music world. I truly enjoy performing with others, and actively demonstrate to my students my enthuiasm. I believe that maintaining an active performance career is essential to being an effective
                educator.

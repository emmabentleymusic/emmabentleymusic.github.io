## Program Notes
This special evening of chamber music pairs two of the most beloved works in the clarinet quintet repertoire. Both pieces showcase the unique blend of clarinet with string quartet, highlighting the instrument's warmth and expressivity in intimate musical dialogue.

### Mozart Clarinet Quintet
Known as the "Stadler Quintet," this work was composed in 1789 for Anton Stadler. It exemplifies Mozart's mature style, combining virtuosity with profound musical expression.

### Brahms Clarinet Quintet
Composed in 1891, this quintet was inspired by clarinetist Richard Mühlfeld, whose playing brought Brahms out of retirement. The work is known for its autumnal warmth and introspective character.

## Reviews
> "The ensemble's performance of the Brahms quintet was particularly moving, with Bentley's clarinet weaving seamlessly through the string texture while maintaining its own distinct voice." - *Chamber Music Today*
